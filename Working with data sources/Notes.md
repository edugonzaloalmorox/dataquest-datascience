# Introduction to Databases


-Working with `.csv` files is important when. 

        - Data fits in memory.

        - Data is relatively static (does not need to be loaded into memory)

        - Only a single person is accessing the data

        - Security is not too important

-Otherwise, it is more convenient to work with data store in database.

-A database is a data representation that lives in a disk and can be queried, accessed and updated without using much memory. 

-`SQL` is used to work with data stored in database. Each unique request is considered a single query.

- `Microsoft Azure` and `AWS` are setups in the cloud.

- `Postgres`  and `MySQL` include powerful features for managing user credentials, security, and high data throughput (quickly changing data).

## Main query functions

-`select`: select columns 

- `where`: filtering columns

    - in `where` you can add conditions (`and`, `or`)

- We can use () to enclose the logic we want and evaluated it in the parentheses.

- `ORDER BY` is used to rank the queries. 

## Summary statistics

- In SQL everything is a table.

    - Good for reaching wider audiences

    - Bad since it requires conversions of numbers and dataframes

- `Aggregate functions` are applied over columns of values and return a single value

## Group summary statistics

- `GROUP BY` allows for grouped operations. It is possible to compute summary statistics by unique value of the group.

## Querying Virtual Columns With the HAVING Statement

- We canÂ´t use `WHERE` after `GROUP BY`. For example use `WHERE` on variables that are have been created. 

- We use `HAVING` whe we we want to filter on a column generated by a `GROUP BY` query

- We use  `ROUND` to round decimal values


## Other functions of interest

- `PRAGMA_TABLE_INFO(table)` gives information on the table

- `CAST()` is used when we divide two integer columns and we want to keep the decimal - otherwise it returns an integer number. This is called 
**`casting`**
